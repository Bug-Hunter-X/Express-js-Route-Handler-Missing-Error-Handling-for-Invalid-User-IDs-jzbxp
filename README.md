# Express.js Route Handler Missing Error Handling for Invalid User IDs

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers:  lack of error handling for invalid input.  The `bug.js` file shows a route that attempts to access a user by ID.  However, it fails to handle cases where the provided ID is not a valid integer, potentially causing the server to crash or return unexpected results.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling, demonstrating best practices for handling invalid input and preventing server errors.

## Bug
The `bug.js` file shows the original code with the missing error handling.  It attempts to parse the `userId` as an integer without checking its validity.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution that includes error handling to gracefully manage invalid user IDs, ensuring that the server remains stable and returns appropriate error messages to the client.
